class MakeCollage(object):
    """
    Class that creates the collage from list of images.

    Collage that should be as close to the shape of a square.

    The images must be arranged in the sequence of the list,
    they are arranged by timestamp of the frames.

    Example:
    Let's say we have a list with 9 images.
    As the images should be arranged in a way to resemble a
    square, we take the square root of 9 and that is 3. Now
    we need to make a 3x3 frames collage.

    Arrangement should be:
    Img1 Img2 Img3
    Img4 Img5 Img6
    Img7 Img8 Img9

    If the number of images is not a perfect square, calculate the
    square root and round it to the nearest integer.

    If number of images is 13, which is not a perfect square.

    sqrt(13) = 3.605551275463989
    round(3.605551275463989) = 4

    Thus the image should be 4x4 frames of collage.

    Arrangement should be:
    -----------------------------
    |  Img1  Img2  Img3   Img4  |
    |  Img5  Img6  Img7   Img8  |
    |  Img9  Img10 Img11  Img12 |
    |  Img13  X     X      X    |
    -----------------------------

    X denotes the empty space due to lack of images.
    But the empty spaces will not affect the robustness
    as downsized version of the video will also have these
    vacant spaces.
